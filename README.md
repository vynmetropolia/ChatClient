## Object-Oriented design patterns are used in the client application:

### Creational Design Patterns:
 **-Singleton design pattern** : The Singleton Pattern ensures a class has only one instance, and provides a global access point for it. In this application, it is used in network service.

### Structural Design Patterns:
 **-Adapter** :Adapter pattern lets two incompatible classes to work with each other without the need to modify both their source codes. This is done by converting the interface of one class into an interface expected by the clients.
In Android, it uses a lot of adapter pattern when it comes to handling ListView or RecyclerView data. In this application, a recyclerView is used for displaying the chat messages to screen.
